This is a passion project that I've been working on. 'Keyframe' is an application that serves as a social app and portfolio app for animators, artists, and storytellers that allows them to connect with other artists, as well as share their work, as well as their progress on other projects they are working on. This app will utilize databases to store user information as well as media that users upload. The app is currently in development, however, the CodeSandBox link attached to this GitHub will allow you to preview what the application currently looks like. Happy to answer any questions about it!
